# SpheroRVR_Mapping_Project
A structured repository for a mapping project written in MATLAB for the Sphero RVR Platform.

USAGE:

The root file of this structure will be 'MATLAB' merge this with your matlab directory for code to be used and uploaded to Sphero. 
As all functions are in their own direcory they should not conflict with your own custom functions as long as they are not run in any higher directory path than the project.

If you don't wish to merge this with your matlab directory you can save this somewhere else and set your path within the file as you work on the robot.
